# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My capstone idea is for a quiz creation app. It would be for teachers or homeschooling parents. The user would be able to create quizzes by first selecting a question type, for example, Multiple Choice, True/False, etcâ€¦ Then they would be able to enter the text for the question, and if needed, the possible answers. And finally, they would enter the correct answer. After that, a quiz would be generated for their students to use. The results would then be scored and stored for both teachers and students to view.

### Features
Some of the features would be, 1) a Sign-up/Login page for both teachers and students. 2) Quiz creation page. 3) Quiz results page

### Technologies
I would need to use Java, Javascript, Spring Boot, MySQL, Hibernate and Thymeleaf templates

### What I'll Have to Learn
I do want to add some Javascript to it to make it more interactive.
